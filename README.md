# Statistics Project
A project completed for my statistics course in Spring 2017. In this project, I perform two hypothesis tests to gain insights on 1) whether Stephen Curryâ€™s mean 3-point percentage in home games differs from his mean 3-point percentage in away games and 2) whether there is a dependency between the number of rest days and game outcome for the Cleveland Cavaliers.
