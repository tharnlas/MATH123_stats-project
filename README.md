# Statistics Project
A project completed for my statistics course in Spring 2017 (recreated in a Jupyter notebook). In this project, I perform a hypothesis test to gain insights on whether Stephen Curryâ€™s mean 3-point percentage in home games differs from his mean 3-point percentage in away games.
